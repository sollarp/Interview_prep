# Split the treasure

Banch of pirates find a chest of valuable golds. However they are so progressive they will only take the treasure if it can be split equally between them, otherwise they will just bury it again.

Each golds are represented by an integer which represents its value (in your choice of currency) and the treasure chest can be represented by a list of all the values.

E.g. [4, 4, 4] represents three golds each of value 4

Write a program that says whether the treasure can be split or not and how the treasure needs to be split

## Example chests

[4,4,4] can be split between three pirates with each one receive one gold

[27,7,20] can only be split between two pirates

[6,3,2,4,1] can be split between two pirates (8 each, [6, 2], [3,4,1]) but not between three or four

[3,2,7,7,14,5,3,4,9,2] can be split between four treasure seekers.

## Bonus question
Code does'nt contain this question!

Given four pirates and a chest with the following gems: [3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]. Can the treasure be split?
